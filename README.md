**🚀 Rust Disk Cache with Encryption 🛡️**

Welcome to the Rust Disk Cache with Encryption repository! 🎉 This project boasts a robust disk caching system implemented in Rust, fortified with encryption to safeguard your precious data. Engineered to optimize performance through asynchronous IO and concurrency, it stands as a stalwart solution adaptable to a myriad of Rust applications.

**🌟 Features**

    Asynchronous IO: Harnesses Tokio's asynchronous IO prowess for lightning-fast disk operations, bolstering performance and scalability.
    Concurrency: Fortifies cache operations with thread-safe paradigms using Arc, Mutex, and Semaphore, enabling seamless concurrent access and modification of cache entries.
    Encryption: Ensures data integrity with robust key and nonce management through AES-GCM encryption, guaranteeing impregnable confidentiality.
    Configuration: Flexibly customizable cache behavior with support for loading configuration from environment variables.
    Systemd Service Generation: Empowers effortless deployment of Rust-based services with auto-generation of systemd service files based on user input.

**💻 Usage**

    Clone the Repository:
   
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/rust-disk-cache.git
   
    cd rust-disk-cache

    cargo run

 Follow the Prompts to create a systemd service file and enable the service or manually configure it do something else.

**🚀 Getting Started**

Integrating the disk cache into your Rust application is a breeze:

    Import Modules: Bring in the DiskCache struct and related modules into your project.
    Create an Instance: Instantiate a new DiskCache with your desired configuration.
    Store and Retrieve Data: Utilize the set method to store data and get method to retrieve data from the cache.
    Customize Behavior: Tailor cache behavior by tweaking configuration and eviction policies.
