To integrate your Rust application as a service that can be managed with `systemd`, you would create a `systemd` service unit file rather than using a `.toml` configuration file for the `systemd` specifics. This service unit file tells `systemd` how to manage your application, including how to start, stop, and restart it, as well as any dependencies it might have.

Here is how you can create a `systemd` service unit file for your Rust application:

1. **Create the Service Unit File**: Service unit files typically reside in `/etc/systemd/system/` and have the extension `.service`. For your application, you might create a file named `/etc/systemd/system/cache_management_system.service`.

2. **Define the Service**: The content of the file should define how `systemd` should manage your Rust application. Here's an example based on the previous discussions:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Cache Management System Service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=your_user
Group=your_group
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/application
ExecStart=/path/to/your/executable
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
Environment="RUST_LOG=info"
EnvironmentFile=-/path/to/your/.env

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Replace `/path/to/your/application` with the directory where your Rust application resides, and `/path/to/your/executable` with the full path to the compiled binary of your Rust application. `EnvironmentFile=-/path/to/your/.env` points to an optional environment file that `systemd` will load before starting your service (the `-` prefix means the service won't fail if this file is missing).

3. **Enable and Start Your Service**:
   - Reload `systemd` to recognize your new service file:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl daemon-reload
     ```
   - Enable your service to start on boot:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl enable cache_management_system.service
     ```
   - Start your service immediately:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start cache_management_system.service
     ```
   - Check the status of your service:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status cache_management_system.service
     ```

This setup assumes your Rust application's executable is a standalone binary that doesn't require an interactive terminal to run. Adjust the `User` and `Group` directives to match the user and group you want the service to run under, and ensure they have the necessary permissions for all operations your application performs.

Remember, managing applications with `systemd` provides robustness and integrates well with Linux systems, making it easier to ensure your application is always running as expected.
